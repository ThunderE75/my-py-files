1.	Start the Python interpreter and type help(‘print’) to get information about the print statement.
2.	If you run a 10-kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, calculate your average time per mile and your average speed in miles per hour using Python
Calculator. (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).
3.	Write a function to calculate the square of first n natural numbers.
4.	Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
+ - - - -+ - - - -+
|	|	 |
|	|	 |
| 	|	 |
| 	|	 |
+ - - - -+ - - - -+
| 	|	 |
| 	|	 |
| 	|	 |
| 	|	 |
+ - - - -+ - - - -+ 
5.	Write a function that takes four parameters—a, b, c and n—and then checks to see if Fermat’s theorem, an + bn = cn, holds. 
If n is greater than 2 and it turns out to be true then the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!” Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t work.”
6.	Write a function that takes a string argument and returns true if it is a palindrome and False otherwise.
7.	A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a function that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power
of b.
8.	Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
9.	Write a function that takes a string as a parameter. Calculate the length of a string without using len function. Print the length concatenated with the string and aligned towards the extreme right of the output screen.
10.	ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter in a word by 13 places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet,
wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so ’A’ shifted by 3 is ’D’ and ’Z’ shifted by 1 is ’A’. Write a function that takes a string and an integer
as parameters, and then returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string “rotated” by the given amount. Use the built-in functions
ord, which converts a character to a numeric code, and chr, which converts numeric codes to characters.
11.	Write a function that takes a nested list of integers and add up the elements from all of the nested lists.
12.	Write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all but the first and last elements. So middle ([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return [2, 3].
13.	Write a program to print the keys of the dictionary and their values in an alphabetical order.
14.	Write a function that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum.
15.	Write a program that reads words.txt and prints only the words with more than 20characters (not counting white space).
